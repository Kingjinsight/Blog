# Title


## Type
Within the research for old machine in the last 3 days, I choose to build a good performance server rather than buy a garbage(cost 1200 rmb). I have 100 credit for azure, maybe it's a good choice to spend all the credits first. Another reason is, when the excitement fades, only a few ideas about the function for my server comes to mind. Maybe learn the components of the server first, and evaluate the specs and pick the best value-for-money option rather than blindly following others.
